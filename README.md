Technologies: Data Cleansing, EDA, Visualization, Machine Learning, Tableau/Power-BI

This project aims to predict horse racing outcomes using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes detailed information on horse races and individual horses from 1990 to 2020. Given the complexity and inherent unpredictability of horse racing, this project seeks to explore various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
